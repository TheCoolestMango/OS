Recovery, prevention and avoidance
__________________________________
I) Prevention
  1) In case the simplicity is preferable, then prevention with attacking the Mutual-Exclusion Condition is a simple strategy, however it could lead to livelock;
  2) In case only a certain type of resourses is needed Prevention with attacking the No-Preemption Condition;
  3) In case of working in batch, prevention with attacking No-Preemption Condition works well in batch, but it requires to know all of the resourses before working; 
  
II) Avoidance
  4) And in case it's preferable that there would be no preemption, the Avoidance strategy does not require it, but it may block process for long periods of time 
     as well as future resourse requirements have to be known in advance
